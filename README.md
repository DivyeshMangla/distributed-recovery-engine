# Distributed Recovery Engine

**Goal:**  
Build a distributed system that can notice when parts fail and recover on its own without human input.

**Scope:**  
The project explores how multiple nodes communicate, detect failures, and restore normal operation when things go wrong.  
It focuses on correctness and reliability under crashes and network issues, not on user interfaces or product features.
